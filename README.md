Springboard Exercise

## Learning
Great exercise. I've never made a todo app with out a frame work like react. The hardest thing for me was keeping track of the tasks that were pushed to localstorage. Figuring out how to reference each task with a uniqueId was probably the hardest thing I in countered with this project. I would have also liked to find a new way clean the task string retrevied from local storage. I really don't like using regex.
